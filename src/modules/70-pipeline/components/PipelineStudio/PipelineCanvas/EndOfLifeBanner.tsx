              Harness has made a significant update to the services and environments in CD. Services and Environments
              now have definitions that are associated with the respective object and can be managed independent of the
              pipeline. This change is a forward looking change that wonâ€™t impact your existing pipelines. However, we
              do plan on reducing our support on the service v1 and environments v1 and plan to deprecate by end of
              January. We have an automated migration tool to support our users. Please contact
